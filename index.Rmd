## Calculation and Interpretation of BMI

BMI is calculated the same way for both adults and children. The calculation is based on the following formulas:

###  $$BMI=\frac{weight (kg)}{height (m)^2}=703\frac{weight (lbs)}{height (inch)^2}$$

```{r 1, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=7.5, fig.align='center'}
y1 <- function(x) 18.5*x^2
y2 <- function(x) 25*x^2
curve(y1, 0.2, 2, col = "red", xlab = "Height (m)", ylab = "Weight (kg")
curve(y2, 0.2, 2, col = "red", add = T)
abline(v = 1.65, col = "blue")
abline(h = 25*1.65^2, col = "blue")
abline(h = 18.5*1.65^2, col = "blue")
text(1.8,10,"1.65 m")
text(0.75, 53, "50.4 kg")
text(0.75, 71, "68.1 kg")
lower <- 50.4
upper <- 68.1
```

Example: the person with height 1.65 m has a normal weight range from `r lower` kg to `r upper` kg.
